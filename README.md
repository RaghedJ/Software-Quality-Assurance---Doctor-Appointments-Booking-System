# Software-Quality-Assurance---Doctor-Appointments-Booking-System

As part of our Software Quality Assurance course (CIS 512), our team designed and implemented a comprehensive Software Test Plan and Test Report for a Doctor Appointment Booking System. The project followed the IEEE 829-2008 standard, and our work was divided across two main deliverables:

Assignment 1 – Test Plan
We developed a complete software test plan tailored to our web-based healthcare system. The plan outlined testing objectives, strategy, scope, features to be tested, test types (unit, integration, system, UAT, etc.), environmental requirements, risk analysis, and change management procedures.

Assignment 2 – Test Report
We executed detailed test cases for features like registration, login, appointment booking, notifications, and admin/user management. Our report included both qualitative and quantitative results, bug tracking statistics, and assessments of the testing environment. We also provided pass/fail criteria and analyzed edge-case behaviors.
